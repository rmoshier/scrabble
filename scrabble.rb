# Note that itâ€™s better to use fewer tiles, so if the top score is tied between multiple words, pick the one with the fewest letters.
# But there is a bonus for using all seven letters. If one of the highest scores uses all seven letters, pick that one
# But if the there are multiple words that are the same score and same length, pick the first one in supplied list
